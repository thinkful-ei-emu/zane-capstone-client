# Zap-App

Zap allows users to make an account.After making the account the user can use their username and password to sign in to their own personal inventory. Once inside their own inventory Zap allows users to create items that they would like to keep track of with a few options Such as name, description, price, unit type,quantity, and location. If the user would like to see the products in descending order by name, price , or location that is also an option.If the user has something they would like to change about an already existing item they can update it inside of the system with prefilled out fields on the update form. If the user no longer has a need to keep track of a specific item then they can delete it from their system.
